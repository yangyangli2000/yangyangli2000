'''
PointNet++ for Instance Segmentation.

NOMENCLATURE:
    B is the number of data in each batch
    N is the total number of input points
    C is the dimension of feature or channels
    D is the dimension of coordinate,

    npoint = the number of centers
    nsample = the number of points sampled from each circle 

The dimension of C and D can be extremely confusing, In our code, the D, dimension of the coordinate is 2, x_cc and y_cc and C, the dimension of feature is 2, vr_compensated and rcs.

For more details of these two functions, please refer to Figure 2 of the original paper.
For a detailed explanation concerning parameter choice, please refer to README.md.
